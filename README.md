###### This project is an assignment that I completed for my Object-Oriented Programming in Java class at Langara.

## Student & StudentTester

User can add a student and use the following operations:
1. Access student's name (getName).
2. Access student's address (getAddress).
3. Add course information (addCourse).
4. Calculate student's GPA (calculateGPA).
5. Access student number (getStudentNum).
6. Access student's login ID (getLoginId).
The user can also choose to add a new student and use these options again.
